# Diagonal Ruler

A fork of Manhattan Ruler (https://github.com/caewok/fvtt-manhattan-ruler) by caewok to instead use the alternating diagonals system used by 3.5e, Pathfinder, Pathfinder 2e, 5e's alternate rules, and Anime Campaign, except its system agnostic so you can use it with your own systems.
